I'm Dan. I live in Chicago, ride bikes, make things from fabric and put things on maps. I work for the []Delta Institute](http://www.delta-institute.org) with a great team of environmental entrepreneurs, looking for those rare opportunities to turn a good idea, solid partnerships and a willingness to go out on a limb into environmental, economic and social impact. I work with data (especially of the geographic variety), occasionally contributing a good idea and tracking down means to try it out. 

This space is part experiment, documentation, memory aid, and sounding board. 

##Tech Specs 

Because whether it's computers, bicycles, craft beer or home appliances, everybody loves specs. 

- Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), because static pages are great
- Theme is [Poole](http://github.com/poole/poole) with a few minor style modifications 
- Hosting is by Github Pages
- See my post here ______ for more details
