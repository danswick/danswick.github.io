![the ol' me](/assets/selfie.jpg)

I'm Dan. I live in Chicago, ride bikes, make things from fabric and put things on maps. I work for the [Delta Institute](http://www.delta-institute.org) in Chicago.  

This space is part experiment, documentation, memory aid, and sounding board. Development is ongoing and you can follow along or [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/danswick/danswick.github.io/issues?state=open). 

##Tech Specs 

Because whether it's computers, bicycles, craft beer or home appliances, everybody loves specs. 

- Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), because static pages are great
- Theme is [Poole](http://github.com/poole/poole) with a few minor style modifications 
- Hosting is by Github Pages
- See my post [here](http://danswick.com/2014/setup/) for more details
