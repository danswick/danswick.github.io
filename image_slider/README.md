## A little image slider demo. 

This little demo compares two images of the same size by way of super fun slidey goodness. 

### USAGE

1. Get two (or more) images that you would like to compare. 
2. Resize and/or crop them so they are exactly the same size. 
3. Swap some values in the code! 
    - Change the `width` and `height` values in `style.css`. 
    - Change the choices in the dropdown menu (`#image-select`) in `index.html`. 
    - Change the filepath and/or file key values in the `imagePaths` object in `main.js`.
