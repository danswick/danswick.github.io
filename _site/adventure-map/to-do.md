- clues lead you toward the city
- as you get closer to the city & pick up clues, the style gets darker
- paths only show up when you click on a clue
- clues have a chance of leading you on a zombie path
- you pick up tokens along the way, which are really codes to allow clicking on clues
- following a zombie path increases chances of losing a clue code and also slows you down
- should a hex visit delete the hex? would that make the map faster?
