Dan provides technical and programmatic support across all of Delta’s work, including the areas of green infrastructure, environmental markets, stakeholder engagement and geospatial technology, among others. He holds a BGS in Environmental Studies from the University of Kansas, and before joining the Delta team, he helped run the City of Chicago’s Sustainable Backyards green infrastructure incentive program and provided geospatial analysis for the Chicago Department of Environment. Dan is a native Illinoisan who can often be found exploring Chicago on two wheels, learning new open source software or hunting for the best falafel the Midwest has to offer.
