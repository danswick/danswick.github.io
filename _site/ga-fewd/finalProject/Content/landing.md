## What is the Green Infrastructure Vision? 

The Green Infrastructure Vision (GIV) is a **geospatial dataset** created help describe, characterize and quantify the ecosystem resources of the [Chicago Wilderness Region](#). The GIV unifies a lot of similar but disparate efforts into a single, standardized dataset by:

- Building upon standard data sources, regardless of their place in the region. This will be described in greater detail later.
- Using agreed-upon scientific methods to aggregate each individual dataset into the final, master dataset.

## What is the GIV used for? 

### Local planning

Right now, GIV data is being used all over the Chicago Wilderness region for planning efforts under Chicago Wilderness' [Sustainable Watershed Action Team](http://www.chicagowilderness.org/what-we-do/protecting-green-infrastructure/), or SWAT, program. SWAT is designed to help local land managers and policy-makers make better informed decisions about their green infrastructure resources, and GIV data is often a central component. It is especially helpful for understanding existing resources, making connections between pieces of high-quality land, and identifying sites for expanding green infrastructure resources.

### Measuring the value of our ecosystems

In 2014, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) completed a study that used the complete GIV dataset to determine the economic value of the ecosystems in our region. Following in the spirit of the GIV dataset from which it was derived, this economic data will also be available as a single, standardized regional dataset. 

## What is green infrastructure? 

In recent years, the term "green infrastructure" has come to have multiple meanings, depending on the context. When Chicago Wilderness completed their first GIV assessment in 2004, they viewed green infrastructure as a network of connected ecosystems, together providing more value than any component could provide in isolation. Since then, the term is largely understood to refer to a site-scale, natural [hydrologic](#) feature designed to manage [storm water](#) while providing environmental and community benefits. CMAP provides a balanced definition on their [green infrastructure page](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/livability/open-space/green-infrastructure-vision): 

> Site-scale green infrastructure can be thought of as a suite of practices to handle stormwater that emphasize using vegetation, soils, and natural processes to mimic natural hydrology. Regional green infrastructure, on the other hand, is a planned landscape of connected open spaces that conserves ecosystem functions and provides associated benefits to human populations. 
> 
> Both can be thought of as critical complements and sometimes replacements for "gray infrastructure," like utilities and the road and rail networks. The concept of green infrastructure draws attention to its similarity to the other infrastructure networks that undergird prosperity in the region. Like other forms of infrastructure, it also needs to be managed, restored, and expanded.

    
## How was the GIV created? 

The GIV dataset is built up from many different datasets, so it is tempting to think of it simply as the sum of its parts. However, the final dataset is actually the result of a **modeling methodology** created by [The Conservation Fund](#) in collaboration with the Chicago Wilderness Green Infrastructure Vision Task Force. Full documentation for this methodology is available as part of the [GIV2.0 Final Report](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/documents/10180/11696/GIV20_FinalReport_2012-06.pdf/dd437709-214c-45d6-a036-5d77244dcedb) (2012). The following describes that process in simple terms.

### Define Landscapes

The GIV methodology starts by defining *landscapes*, the primary organizing principle of the entire GIV. 

>Landscapes are a mosaic of
ecosystems or land uses that possess common attributes that are repeated across a large area
(Forman & Godron, 1986)

Landscapes are determined through a combination of a literature review, review of available data, and a stakeholder feedback process. 

- There are four broad landscape categories in the GIV:
    + Woodlands / Forests
    + Prairies / Grasslands / Savannas
    + Wetlands
    + Streams and lakes
 
### Determine **functional connectivity** between and among landscape types 

The scientific community is generally in agreement that a *system of interconnected habitats* is more likely to sustain its natural ecological communities than one that is fractured and isolated from other habitats. In the field of landscape ecology, there are two primary types of connectivity: *structural connectivity*, which refers to the physical characteristics of landscape, and *functional connectivity*, which refers to the landscape's capacity to support movement of organisms and processes. The GIV is focused primarily on *functional connectivity*. 

Functional connectivity was determined using a GIS model called "FunConn," developed by scientists at Colorado State University. The model works by moving theoretical organisms (represented by mathematical models) across the the landscape (represented in GIS by each landscape's component data). Each landscape type is home to a different mix of species and, thus, had to be assessed using a unique combination of representative species.
