Instructions
1) Demo the site and try it out
2) Build the HTML page with all the cards
Hint: You'll probably want to have a div that encapsulates all the game related elements (cards, buttons, winner text), each card should have a card class and a class that says what it is (like the Jacks card would have the class "jacks card")
3) Use CSS to style the game play area.
Hint: Each card should use a "card" class and when "selected" should have a background image that shows the card as it would appear if turned over.
4) Write out the pseudo code for defining how the game is played
5) Translate pseudo code into JS


Happy Coding :)
