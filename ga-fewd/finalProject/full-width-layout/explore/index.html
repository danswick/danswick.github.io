                    <h2>Woodland and Forest</h2>

                    <h3>Pulaski Woods</h3>

                    <p>From the <a href="http://fpdcc.com/pulaski-woods/">Forest Preserve District of Cook County</a>:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        Deep in the largest preserve complex in the county, it’s easy to immerse oneself in nature at Pulaski Woods. Tall oaks greet visitors at the parking lots. Wildflowers such as rose mallow and mushrooms such as the bright orange (and poisonous) jack-o-lantern dot marshland, while American egrets wade in the water. Within the woods, visitors will encounter sunlit openings with swaths of common oak sedge and small, sloughs popular with waterfowl and wet depressions lined with sensitive fern and water horehound. North-facing slopes take on a forest character, with species like basswood, white ash and the uncommon spicebush.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Nature at Palos Woods</h3>

                    <p>This region is home to the Palos Fen, a unique ecosystem not found anywhere else. The <a href="http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/INPC/Pages/Area2cookPalosFen.aspx">Illinois Department of Natural Resources</a> describes the Palos Fen:</p>

                    <blockquote>Palos Fen is a 48 acre graminoid fen, marsh and oak savanna located at the base of the Tinley Moraine where meltwaters from glacial Lake Chicago formerly escaped into the Des Plaines River. The slopes of the moraine support old open-grown oaks and shagbark hickory. Where calcareous groundwater flows from the base of the moraine, saturated soils have fostered the accumulation of organic material. The rich fen community is dominated by big and little bluestem, prairie dropseed and other prairie associates, as well as those species that are well adapted for the wet, calcareous and highly organic soils. These species include swamp betony, Ohio goldenrod, low calamint, bog lobelia and Queen-of-the-prairie. This site preserves the only graminoid fen identified in the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory that has survived on the Chicago Lake Plain. </blockquote>

                    <h3>Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie</h3>
                    
                    <img src="http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5154837.jpg">

                    <p>This unique landscape is the first established National Tallgrass Prairie and is managed by the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/midewin">US Forest Service</a>. It sits on the former site of the Joliet Arsenal and is classified as a "prairie under construction" as the land is gradually restored by staff and volunteers. From the US Forest Service:</p>

                    <blockquote>Midewin represents a major effort to restore 20,000 acres of farmland and industrial land to a unique American landscape and the complex ecology of the prairie. Its mission also includes providing education and recreation opportunities. All of Midewin’s programs and progress are thanks to the support of hundreds of volunteers and partner agencies, businesses, and organizations.
                    <br>
                    Midewin (pronounced mi-DAY-win) is a Potawatomi word, honoring the Native Americans who long historically occupied this area. “Midewin” is the name for their “Grand Medicine society,” a group that both healed individuals and kept the greater Potawatomi society in balance.  The Midewin society’s purpose in healing and balance represented our hopes for the new prairie. 
                    <br>
                    Public access to Midewin was restricted during the Army’s cleanup of contaminants remaining from decades of munitions manufacture, but the first 5,000 acres opened in 2004.  Today, the Army cleanup is complete and 7,200 acres of Midewin and 22 miles of trails are open to the public for nonmotorized recreation.  Midewin will remain a “prairie under construction” for many years to come. 
                    <br>
                    Midewin is also the largest open space in the Chicago metropolitan area and northeastern Illinois. Even while ecological restoration is underway, it offers respite from the urban world and an opportunity to be immersed in a unique landscape within an hour’s drive of downtown Chicago.

                    <h3>Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore</h3>
                    
                    <img src="http://www.nps.gov/mwr/indu/images/8407EDA6-1DD8-B71C-0E610F41E5CA2647.jpg" style="width:100%">

                    <p>At over 15,000 acres, the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/indu/learn/nature/index.htm">Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore</a> is one of the largest shoreline natural areas in the region. The park is home to a wide range of ecosystems, from its namesake dunes, to oak savannas, to a huge variety of wetlands. It is also home to many popular recreational resources, such as hiking, camping and bird watching.</p>

                    <h3>Nature at the Dunes</h3>

                    <p>The National Park Service provides a wide range of information about this unique landscape:</p>

                    <blockquote>Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is a treasure of diverse natural resources located within an urban setting. The national lakeshore features communities that have both scientific and historic significance to the field of ecology. In addition, four National Natural Landmarks and one National Historical Landmark are located within its boundaries. 
                    <br>
                    The park is comprised of over 15,000 acres of dunes, oak savannas, swamps, bogs, marshes, prairies, rivers, and forests. It contains 15 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline spanning the distance from Gary to Michigan City. Lake Michigan is part of the largest complex of freshwater lakes in the world. The national lakeshore's beaches are the park's most significant recreational resource.
                    <br>
                    Immediately inland from the beaches, sand dunes rise to almost 200 feet in a series of ridges, blowouts, and valleys. Extensive wetlands fill many depressions between the dune ridges. The national lakeshore preserves an important remnant of a once vast and unique environment, resulting from the retreat of the last great continental glacier some 14,000 years ago. The park landscape represents at least four major successive stages of historic Lake Michigan shorelines, making it one of the most extensive geologic records of one of the world’s largest, fresh water bodies.
                    <br>
                    The biological diversity within the national lakeshore is amongst the highest per unit area of all our national parks. Over 1,100 flowering plant species and ferns make their homes here. From predacious bog plants to native prairie grasses and from towering white pines to rare algal species, the plant diversity is rich.
                    <br>
                    The wildlife is also diverse. A wide variety of habitats coupled with the moderating effects of Lake Michigan make the region an ideal home for hundreds of animal species. The park is renowned for its bird life; more than 350 species have been observed here. Located on the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the national lakeshore is an especially important feeding and resting area for migrating land and water birds. One area within the national lakeshore has been set aside especially for its value as a great blue heron rookery. </blockquote>

                    <h3>Chain O' Lakes State Park and Region</h3>

                    <p>This waterway system, comprised of 15 lakes connected by both natural and manmade streams, the Chain O' Lakes area is the largest concentration of natural lakes in Illinois. Not only that, but at over 7,100 acres in area with more than 45 miles of river, it is the busiest inland recreational waterway per acre in the United States.</p>

                    <p>Chain O' Lakes State Park and its neighboring conservation areas represent one of Northeastern Illinois' most diverse examples of large-scale stream and lake habitat. From the Illinois Department of Natural Resources:</p>

                    <blockquote>The land making up Chain O'Lakes State Park is chiefly fresh waterbog over deep peat deposits. The river bluff areas and gently sloping morainal hills rise to 200 feet, and were deposited by Illinois' last glacier.
                    <br>
                    Chain O' Lakes has a mixture of oak and hickory hardwood timber. The park also contains cherry, elm, birch, sumac and spruce, providing rich colors that attract numerous visitors each fall, plus some scattered pine plantings.
                    <br>
                    Nature lovers will find a rich assortment of wildflowers in the spring, summer and fall.
                    <br>
                    Historically, Grass Lake once was almost entirely covered with American lotus each summer, and attracted great crowds, including tour boats. Today, some areas of lotus remain within the lake.
                    <br>
                    Two hundred acres of restored native prairie provide nesting habitat for grassland bird species and abundant backdrops for nature photographers.
                    <br>
                    Some of the wildlife park visitors are likely to encounter are white-tailed deer, rabbits, ground squirrels, chipmunks, mink, opossum, skunks, raccoons, gophers, foxes, badgers, beaver, coyotes and groundhogs. A check-list of the nearly 200 birds that have been identified in the park is available at the park office.</blockquote>

                    <h2>Ecological Network</h2>

                    <h3>Hubs and Corridors</h3>

                    <p>This layer is an aggregate of the four main landscape types:</p>

                    <ul class="list-of-landscapes">
                        <li class="woodland">Woodland and Forest</li>
                        <li class="prairie">Prairie, Grassland and Savanna</li>
                        <li class="wetland">Wetland</li>
                        <li class="stream">Streams and Lakes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The ecological network demonstrates one of the GIV's central concepts: that no ecosystem can exist in isolation. It must be connected to other ecosystems, allowing organisms to move about the lansdcape. This is borne out in the concepts of <span class="emphasis">hubs</span> and <span class="emphasis">corridors</span>.</p>

                    <p>The <a href="http://www.conservationfund.org/">Conservation Fund</a> describes this concpet in the GIV2.0 final report:</p>

                    <blockquote>Hubs are aggregations of core areas that combine landscape types in an effort to treat areas as unfragmented blocks that include an array of habitats. Although it is important to identify discrete landscape types for analytical purposes, blocks with diverse habitat types often serve as high quality ‘matrix’ areas where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. For the most part, previous hub delineation methods have focused on simply combining core areas and corridors and optionally adding surrounding buffer areas. There is a significant body of peer reviewed literature that demonstrates that a system of interconnected habitats is more likely to maintain natural communities and ecological processes. Landscape ecology recognizes two different forms of habitat connectivity. Structural connectivity refers to the physical characteristics of landscape elements like shape, size and location of features in the landscape, ignoring the behavioral response of organisms to landscape structure. Functional connectivity, on the other hand, describes the degree to which landscapes actually facilitate or impede the movement of organisms and processes.</blockquote>
