# Final Project - Interactive Explainer for Chicago Green Infrastructure Vision

The [Green Infrastructure Vision](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/livability/open-space/green-infrastructure-vision), or **GIV**, is an onoing project of [Chicago Wilderness](http://www.chicagowilderness.org/) aimed at capturing the value of the Chicago region's natural areas in both ecological and economic terms. The output of the project is a periodically-updated geospatatial dataset and series of reports. To-date, the data behind the project has been made available as a large download, including several geodatabases, ArcMap project files, and ESRI model builder tools. While the availability of this data is appreciated, many organizations have expressed frustration and confusion at putting these tools to use, including: 

1. The data behind the project is only available as a massive (>300mb) download, all of which is in a proprietary format requiring prohibitively expensive software to utilize.
2. It remains difficult to understand exactly what this data represents and how it might be put to use. 
3. Since the project's inception, the term "green infrastructure" has taken on a new meaning among the majority of stakeholders in the conservation and sustainability fields. The GIV's focus on ecological value, while valuable in its own right, is confusing for organizations that have come to understand it in terms of stormwater mitigation alone. 

Through this project, I seek to address these concerns by: 

1. Making data available in open and standard formats. Download size will still be a major concern, so I will only make a subset of the most commonly-requested data available from my tool and will point users to other providers for the full dataset. I will also pre-aggregate the data for several common geographies, allowing users to get a quick sense of magnitudes for the areas they're most concerned with. 
2. I will build an interactive map with an emphasis on clear descriptions and step-by-step descriptions of the GIV's major components. The map will emphasize case studies and common applications. 
3. Users visiting my site will first be greeted by a concise description of what the GIV is and what it is not, leading them to explore the underlying data on their own to gain a better understanding. 

My project will emphasize transparency by utilizing open and well-documented tools ([Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [TileMill](https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill), [geoJSON](http://geojson.org/), etc.) and will be stored and maintained on GitHub.
